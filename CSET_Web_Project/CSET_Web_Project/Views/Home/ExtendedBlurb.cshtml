<p class="attention">2014-2015 Academic Year</p>
<p class="attention">Welcome to the Computer Systems Engineering Department web site at the Oregon Institute of Technology!</p>
<p class="attention">We appreciate that you have chosen to visit our departmental website and hope that you find what you are looking for. If you are currently a student within one of our programs, please consider subscribing to our departmental blog (<a href="http://www.csetoit.blogspot.com/">www.csetoit.blogspot.com</a>). If you are just visiting or looking for a potential university to attend, we urge you to visit us any time you are in the area. The accomplishments of our department are clearly illustrated by the continual success of our graduates, with whom our faculty has tried to establish strong relationships. Within the CSET department you are much more than just another student – you become part of an ever growing family.</p>
<p class="attention">In addition to our Software Engineering Technology program and our Computer Engineering Technology program, the CSET department is excited to mark the beginning of the fifth year of our new Embedded Systems Engineering Technology program. This past year we also received authorization from the Oregon University System to expand our Embedded Systems program to our Portland campus. Similar to our other offerings, the Embedded Systems program is designed to be completed in four years.</p>
<p class="attention">This past summer saw a variety of activities within our department. For example, Project Lead the Way was offered for two-weeks under the direction of Claude Kansaku with Doug Lynn serving as one of the faculty members. A week-long game camp for middle and high school students was offered by Jay Bockelman and Randy Albert. In parallel with the game camp for younger students, Sherry Yang directed a game camp for teachers associated with SuperQuest and the TechStart Education Foundation. Through the efforts of a number of faculty the department also received numerous grants, including 25 Atom systems from Intel awarded to Jim Long and Jay Bockelman. Likewise, Ralph Carestia continued to receive software grants for various design tools and development boards from such companies as Altera, Xilinx, and Mentor Graphics. This summer also saw the arrival of our newest faculty member, Assistant Professor David Bishop. David comes to us from Hawaii and we are very excited to have him join us!</p>
<p class="attention">OIT recently acquired the former InFocus building in Wilsonville where many of the Portland-area campuses will be soon be consolidated. For our department this means that in the next few years both the Portland based Software program and the recently expanded Embedded Systems program in the Portland area will eventually be moved from Hillsboro to Wilsonville.</p>
<p class="attention">This is truly an exciting time for our students, faculty, and graduates. While the job market has become more challenging, it continues to demonstrate tremendous growth potential and most of our students find great opportunities in industry or academia.</p>
<p class="attention">If you have any questions regarding any of the offerings within the CSET department, please feel free to visit us anytime. You are always welcome and we believe that you will find our students, faculty, and staff a very approachable, supportive, kind, bright, dynamic, and enjoyable group of individuals to work with.</p>
<p class="attention">Sincerely,</p>

				Professor Calvin Caldwell<br />
				Department Chair, Computer Systems Engineering Technology<br />
